## Contributing and Submitting Issues / Enhancement Requests

Feel free to make improvements the projects, especially the samples and test projects, or submit other new items by creating issues or pull requests on the [GitHub page](https://github.com/jsimpso81/FRC_IV_TrajLib_Util_and_Samp).

### Use the Issues section on Github to report problems and suggest enhancements.

1. When reporting a problem be as specific as possible.
1. Include instructions on how to duplicate the issue.
1. If possible, submit a small sample program that reproduces the problem.
1. If requesting an enhancement, mark it as such.

### Pull Request Guidelines

You may submit pull requests even if they don't meet these guidelines however they may not be merged into the master branch until they do.

Submissions may be rejected for any reason, but mostly if they don't align with the purpose of the samples as teaching aids.  This repository is for samples, test programs, and utility programs.  To contribute to the FRC LabVIEW Trajectory Library see that repository, 
[FRC LabVIEW Trajectory Library](https://github.com/jsimpso81/FRC_IV_TrajLib)

If you have questions, please ask.

1. All LabVIEW code should have the "Separate compiled code from source file" option turned on. 
1. Samples should be simple when possible and only demonstrate a single concept.  (Some of the existing samples break this rule!)
