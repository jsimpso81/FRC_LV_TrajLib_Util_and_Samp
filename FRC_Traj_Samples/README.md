## FRC_Traj_Samples Project


This LabVIEW project contains a number of sample programs using the Trajectory Library.  These are intended to used for training and as samples of how to use particular functionality.  This project is a work in progress. Contributions of new sample VIs are welcome.  See the `readme.md` file in the repository root for additional details.

### Current Samples

- **Geometry Demo** -- Pose2d, Translation2d, Rotation2d
- **PID and advanced PID**
- **Timer**
- **Slew Rate Limiter**
- **Filter** -- Median Filter, Linear Filter (moving average, 1st, 2nd order Butterworth high and low pass)
