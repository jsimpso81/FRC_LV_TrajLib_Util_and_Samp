This project contains utility programs for use with the FRC LabVIEW Trajectory Libraryand Jaci's Pathfinder version 1.x  THe utility programs are:

	-- Create Trajectory Using Trajectory Library

	-- Convert PathWeaver JSON file to Trajectory Library CSV file.

	-- Create Trajectory Using Pathfinder (Display differential drive)

	-- Create Trajectory Using Pathfinder (Display swerve drive)


The end result of all of these utilities is the creation of a Trajectory Library CSV file.  These files can be stored on the RoboRIO and read by the robot program.  

These programs can be compiled into x86 executables.  The executables can be run without LabVIEW installed.
